            DESTROY

        </hi>


        <P>

            You look at the letter and say oh uh uh<br>
            I am not going to go down this rabbit hole. <br>
            You take the letter and rip it into small pieces. You then take those pieces and put them into your favorite burn bucket.<br>
            Pulling out a book of matches, you light one, bringing it up you you inhale lighting your special hand rolled.<br> Dropping the match into your burn bucket you set it and all the other stuff you don't want to deal with on fire, take that IRS <br>
